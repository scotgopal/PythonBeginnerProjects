# Python Beginner Projects
Project Based Learning: 6 Basic Python Beginner Projects Tutorials and Example Code with Windows Executables

_Project Ideas Inspired By: Ilyaas Lunat through his post [here.](https://www.codementor.io/@ilyaas97/6-python-projects-for-beginners-yn3va03fs#rock-paper-scissors-game)_

## Steps
1. Read the projectdetails.md file for details on the project.
2. Open the project folders and run the .exe file to get an idea of how the program should work.
3. Try to develop your own coding based on your understanding of core Python coding and use the tips given below.
4. The codings of the executable file is available for your perusal.

## Tips for Each Project

### Project 1
1. Used random and time (optional) libraries
2. Used basic conditional statements: if, elif, else; while;

### Project 2
1. Used random, time, os and system libraries
2. Familiarise with raising exceptions as this involves with user input
3. Used basic conditional statements: if, elif, else; while;

### Project 3
1. Libraries used include matplotlib.pyplot and numpy
2. Learn the difference between np.arange and np.linspace
3. Basic plot information such as title, legend etc

### Project 4
1. Used random, os and string library
2. New way to exit program using global variable
3. Understand more on using string library to get info on alphabets and digits. Avoid creating dictionaries that are already available.
4. Learn to extract info from list types and convert to string

### Project 5
1. Used string, random, os, time and sys libraries
2. Learn to open and read .txt files
3. Learn to utilise and manipulate list datatypes; reading each element in a list.
4. You may check your coding time to time (without entering debug mode) by using print() at the right places. Surely helps in understanding the problem that you will face, and saves time too!
5. Workflow:-\
    a. Read and store words from .txt file\
    b. Create programme header\
    c. Select word that has to be guessed and display to player.
    d. Check user inputs for each guess. Update if they have guessed correctly. I made my program to record what are the letters that the user had already used.
    e. Let them know if they manage to guess all letters without making 6 mistakes. Else exit programe. I gave my player the ability to decide if they want to play again. ;)\
6. __p/s: Make sure when you run the .exe, it has the '_sowpod.txt_' in the same directory.__

### Project 6
1. Used random, os, sys, time and numpy library
2. Utilise functions to allow code jumping (as a replacement for 'goto' in C programming)
3. Add print() functions to understand the code functionality while you're coding the project. I used them A LOT particularly for this project.

**P/S** : I am also a beginner myself, so if you think there is something that can be improved, please bring up a new Issue in GitHub. I am happy to be learning on ways to improve on my coding. Please also feel free to comment on my work or if you have learnt something new through the examples. Thank you and good luck learning Python!!
